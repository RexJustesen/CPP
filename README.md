## C++ Notes, Design Patterns, and Tips 

This repository contains a collection of notes, design patterns, and practical tips for C++ programming. It serves as a reference for learning and applying C++ best practices, advanced techniques, and essential design patterns.

### Contents 
- **C++ Notes**: In-depth explanations and examples of C++ features, language constructs, and standard libraries. 
- **Desig Patterns in C++** : Implementation and use cases of common design pattern in C++.

### Getting Started
Clone the Repository and explore the notes and examples. 

*Note*: I use [[https://obsidian.md/]] for linking and for taking notes which is why you see a .obsidian file in the repo. You don't have to use it as the files are all markdown. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RexJustesen/CPP.git
```

### Contributing 
Feel free to suggest improvements, add patterns, or expand on notes by opening a pull request.
