- Debugging a huge part of programming and learning to program as you learn how the computer allocates memory and runs your program. 

### Topics 
- Breakpoints 
- Reading Memory 

### What is debugging 
- To remove bugs. 
- You need to diagnose what is wrong  with your program. 
- You need to know the computer is always (99.9%) correct. 
- It is always some mistake the programmer did when writing the code. 

### Setting a Breakpoint 
- A breakpoint is a point in the program where the debugger will "break" or pause the program and let the programmer look at the state of the memory of the code. 
- The memory of a running program is all that there is when you break it down. 
- in order to set a breakpoint in visual studio you can prese **F9** and it will set a break point on the line where your cursor is  or you can move your curser to the left hand side of the line number and click in the sidebar and you will see a red stop sign symbol appear. 
- When you run the code the program will run until the breakpoint and then show you where the program is in Visual Studio. 
- there will be three button in the top, *continue*, *step into*, *step over*, *step out* 
- **Continue** will continue executing the rest of the code after the breakpoint. 
- **Step into** will step into the current function that is on the line of code the debugger is on if there is a function on that line. 
- **Step over** will step over the current function on the line and go to the next line. 
- **Step out** will step out of the current function and take us back to whatever called the function.
